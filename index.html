									<h3>About Us</h3>
									<h4>What is Tin on a Wall?</h4>
									<p>Our team of North Tyneside volunteers collect none perishable food from our neighbours every first Saturday of the month at 2pm.  July through to September we collected the 2nd on each month at 7pm however as the late nights set in we changed to a Saturday day time.  Every month we support a different charity or community group within North Tyneside to help those effected by poverty in these difficult times.  We want to support all foodbanks and groups no matter what their size of operations, large and well known or small lesser known groups which are often easier to access by individuals and very much depend on our support.  We ask for volunteers every month which will dictate which streets we are able to collect from.  10 days before the event we circulate a street list of all streets participating, including drop off boxes in case residents want to donate but do not have someone picking up in their street.</p>
									<h4>Why was this group set up?</h4>
									<p>The COVID crisis has affected people with devastating results. Not only has it caused a mass loss of life but also economic and social disruption. Millions of people are now at risk of falling into poverty and don't have access to food.
										Lucy Hearn (Campaign Manager) saw a shared social media post of an incredible food collection by Risca, a group in Wales.  Volunteers at Risca gathered food which they were able to donate to their local food bank which was enough stock for 6 - 9 months – all in a single night.  Lucy thought this was something we needed in the North East, specifically in her local area in North Tyneside.   Risca provided advice on how to set up Tin on a Wall and in July Tin on a Wall North Tyneside was born. </p>
									<h4>How was this group set up?</h4>
									<p>Lucy posted in many social media sites asking for volunteers and within hours she had over 20 volunteers for the first collection in July.  The number of volunteers and number of streets has grown month on month, supporting a different charity, food bank or community group each month.  After 2 collections, the administrative work involved was too much for one person, so Lucy sent out a SOS to all volunteers and a little group was formed.  Joanne, involved from the beginning as a Street Champion offered to take on more of the administrative work or coordinating the volunteers for Lucy.   In November we collected from almost 200 streets in North Tyneside with the supports of over 80 volunteers.  Most of our business communications and growth has been through social media, radio, word of mouth and leaflets.</p>
									<h4>Who is Tin on a Wall?</h4>
									<p>All who participate are volunteers:
										Lucy Hearn – Champaign Founder and Manager 
										Joanne Scorer – Champaign Coordinator 
										All our amazing Area Champions each month
										All our amazing Street Champions each month</p>
									<h4>Can we operate during lockdown?</h4>
									<p>Yes, we are classed as volunteers and therefore exempt from restrictions however we ask all government guidelines are followed to sure the safety of all. </p>

									<h3>Join Us</h3>
									<h4>What does a volunteer do?</h4>
									<p>You would put forward a street, usually where you live, but you can do more than one if you would like, to take part in the event. You would do this by filling in a registration form for the forthcoming month which can be found on our facebook page. The area and the streets will collect from each month is entirely dependent upon volunteers who come forward. The week before the event we provide leaflets to let your neighbours know about the campaign. On the day, you would collect food items (zero contact) from outside the houses of your street(s) and take to a nearby location the same day.</p>
									<h4>Live outside of North Tyneside? </h4>
									<p>If you wanted to set up your own campaign outside on the North East, we would share all our practices with you, drop us a message.</p>
